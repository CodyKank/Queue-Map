* The Queue map was started in early August, 2016

* Development branch was created in March, 2017

* It is inspired by Dr. Thain's Condor Matrix map. http://condor.cse.nd.edu/condor_matrix.cgi

* This is currently a work in progress, and was started as a test-bed and is just now moving into github.

* This branch will not work or function in its present state, and is merely here to hold ideas and be 
  a central place to contain ideas for the development of QueueMap.

* There are plans to implement a system which will create a page for each hostgroup defined by
  UGE in an HPC environment. Each hostgroup will then have its own set of nodes associated with it, with
  the typical memory pages and core usage pages associated with each node.

* There are also plans for a 'search' page, which an HTML search with predefined hostgroups to easily
  find the hostgroup a user etc. is searching for.
