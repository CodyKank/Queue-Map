* The CRC Queue map was started in early August, 2016 by intern Cody Kankel

* It is visually based of of Dr. Thain's Condor Matrix map.

* The map works by having a python script run as a daemon on the crcfe1 
which gathers the needed information and dumps it to a file (index-long.html etc)
then it sleeps for 2 minutes and repeats. Then, there must be a cron job -
-(or something equilivent) to gather those files every  2 minutes preferrably.
 Then those files must make their ways to the proper directories for the web
server to display them properly. 

* The idea is to have the webserver setup to have the pages loaded by php to display
as html, as to have a 'dynamic' website.

* NOTE: the python daemon on the front end is python 3.4.0 FYI.

* Installation:
            There is a script which (in theory) will set up the necesarry
            files for you on your webserver. It is assumed you already have
            apache and php installed and running, if need be Google that and
            you'll have your answers on how to do that.
            Once the necesarry files are in place on server side, you then must
            start the daemon on the front end. Once that daemon is running
            view it through your localhost on a web browser and ensure all is
            well.
